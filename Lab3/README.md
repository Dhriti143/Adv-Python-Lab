# Image Data Processing Tool

## Overview

This Python program is designed for image data processing, providing a user-friendly interface for loading, displaying, and manipulating images. The tool utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library for efficient handling of image data.

## Features

### 1. Image Loading and Display

   - Users can load an image file in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) and display it within the program.

### 2. Image Manipulation

   - Users can perform at least two image manipulation operations, including:
      - Applying filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, edge detection).
      - Changing image dimensions or cropping.
      - Adjusting brightness, contrast, or saturation.
      - Converting to grayscale or other color spaces.

### 3. Histogram Analysis

   - The tool provides a feature to calculate and display histograms for different color channels of the loaded image.
   - Users can analyze and manipulate histogram data, enhancing their understanding of image color distribution.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageDataProcessing.git
   cd ImageDataProcessing
