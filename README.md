# Adv-Python-Lab
The AdvPythonLab repository is a comprehensive collection of advanced Python programming lab exercises and projects. It serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking to enhance their Python programming skills through hands-on practice and exploration of advanced concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple Python scripts designed for various purposes. Here's a brief overview of each script:

### 1. Customer Feedback Analysis

In this lab, we analyze customer feedback data stored in text files. The provided Python script reads, extracts relevant information, calculates average review ratings, and identifies the top 3 products. Check the `Lab1\analyze_reviews.py` file for more details.

### 2. Railway Ticket Reservation System

Implementing a railway ticket reservation system for a busy rail network. Functionalities include loading train and passenger data, checking seat availability, updating seat availability, and generating reports. Find more details in the `Lab2\railway_reservation_system.py` file.

### 3. Image Data Processing Tool

A Python program for image data processing, providing a user-friendly interface for loading, displaying, and manipulating images. Utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library. Explore `Lab3\image_processing_tool.py` for implementation details.

### 4. User Authentication and Tweet Processing

This Python code simulates user registration, authentication, tweet processing, and a Twitter-like application. It also includes a code evolution simulator. Logs are emphasized for understanding, debugging, and monitoring. Refer to `Lab4\twitter_simulator.py` for more information.

### 5. File Backup Script

A simple file backup solution scheduling periodic backups using the `schedule` library. Users can specify source and destination folders, and the script will perform backups at scheduled times. See `Lab5\file_backup.py` for details.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use each script and any dependencies required.
